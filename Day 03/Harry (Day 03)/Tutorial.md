# Day 3 - Modules and pip in Python!

A **module** is like a code library that allows us to reuse code written by others in our Python program. There are two types of modules in Python:

## Types of Modules in Python

### 1. Built-in Modules  
These modules are **pre-installed** with the Python interpreter, meaning there is no need to install them separately. Examples include `math`, `random`, and `os`.

### 2. External Modules  
These modules are **developed by third parties** and must be installed using a package manager like **pip** or **conda**. Since they are written by others, different versions of the same module may exist over time.

## The `pip` Command  
`pip` is Pythonâ€™s package manager used to install external modules.  

To install a module, use the following command:  

```sh
pip install pandas
