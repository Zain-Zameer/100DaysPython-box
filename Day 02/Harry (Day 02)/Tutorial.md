# Day 2 - My Python Success Story

## Why I love Python (And you will too...)

Welcome to **Day 2 of 100 Days of Code**. Let me start with a story!

Back in my college days, I used to learn **C and C++ programming** in depth and scored good marks. I created a bunch of printing, conditionals, and loop programs. Now what? I wanted to benefit from the same.

In my second year of college, I started working (I mean actually working in the industry) with the **Python programming language**. I was not so good with it, but I used to write code for a **Singaporean client** and actually made good money without having to master Python. 

Harry then got curious and started working on his Python skills even more. I then got into **web scraping**, and trust me, I made some **easy money on Fiverr** just by writing some Python programs and charging on a per-webpage basis to my clients (I used to automate scraping).

I then learned **Flask** and got to work with Flask alongside a university professor abroad. **Long story short, Python made a huge impact on my career.**

## What can Python do for you?

I want to show you some **Python programs** I created, which will surely inspire you to create your own versions as we progress through this tutorial. 

> тЪая╕П **If you are a beginner**, do not try to recreate them just yet. We will make progress gradually. Trust me! ЁЯЪА
