# Day 1 - What is Programming and Python?

## What is Programming?
Programming is a way for us to tell computers what to do. A computer is a very dumb machine and it only does what we tell it to do. Hence, we learn programming and tell computers to do what we are very slow at - computation.

If I ask you to calculate `5 + 6`, you will immediately say `11`. How about `23453453 x 56456`? You will start searching for a calculator or jump to a new tab to calculate the same.

This **100 days of code** series will help you learn Python from start to finish. We will start from **zero**, and by the time we end this course, I promise you will be a **job-ready Python developer**!

## What is Python?
Python is a **dynamically typed, general-purpose** programming language that supports both **object-oriented programming** and **functional programming** approaches.

- Python is an **interpreted** and **high-level** programming language.
- It was created by **Guido Van Rossum** in **1989**.

### Features of Python:
- **Simple and easy to understand**.
- **Interpreted and platform-independent**, which makes debugging very easy.
- **Open-source** programming language.
- Provides **extensive library support**. Some popular libraries include:
  - `NumPy`
  - `TensorFlow`
  - `Selenium`
  - `OpenCV`
- Allows integration with **other programming languages**.

## What is Python used for?
- **Data Visualization** - To create plots and graphical representations.
- **Data Analytics** - To analyze and understand raw data for insights and trends.
- **AI and Machine Learning** - To simulate human behavior and learn from past data without hard coding.
- **Web Development** - To create web applications.
- **Database Management** - To handle and process databases.
- **Business and Accounting** - To perform complex mathematical operations and analysis.

## Why Replit?
- **Easy to share tutorials and code**.
- You can easily **fork this Repl** and continue learning in your own style.
- Video, code, and text tutorials all in the same place make learning easier!
- For **fellow teachers**, you can create a `.tutorial` folder to create tutorials using Replit.
